Go build + package + distributions

There are a lot of golang open souce project, sometime we want to share code, sometimes we want to share binary file to friends.
But few website offers golang binary shares. So I created one.

### How to use
	wget gobuild.io/github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch/v1.0/linux/amd64 -O fswatch.zip

-- unfinished --
	wget gobuild.io/linux/amd64/v1.0/github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch/fswatch.zip

### .gobuild.yml
use `.gobuild.yml` file, you can use more function with <https://gobuild.io>.

first you need to add a file `.gobuild.yml` into project root.

For beego project: (platform will will invode `bee pack -f zip`)

	framework: beego
	
For revel project: (`revel package`)

	framework: revel

For self define which file should be packaged.(excludes is not working now).
And binary file is defaulted added, you don't need to worry about it.

	filesets:
		includes:
			- static
			- LICENSE
			- README.md
		excludes:
			- CHANGELOG

There is a default for every project: see [default gobuildrc](public/gobuildrc)

### other build tool support
support [gopm](http://gopm.io).

Test is `.gopmfile` exists in project root, then use alias go=gopm instead.
### add badge
[![Gobuild Download](http://gobuild.io/badge/github.com/codeskyblue/gobuild/download.png)](http://gobuild.io/github.com/codeskyblue/gobuild)
